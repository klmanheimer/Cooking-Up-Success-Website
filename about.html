          <h2>Lore</h2>
            <p>
              Once a promising chef in Naples, Vittorio Bellini was the kind of man who could make a pizza sing. 
              His nonna taught him everything—how to knead dough with love, how to balance basil like poetry, and 
              how to taste life in every bite. Vittorio dreamed of opening his own pizzeria, but life had other 
              plans.One tragic night, a fire tore through his family’s restaurant. Not only did he lose the kitchen 
              he called home, but he also lost his father—his greatest supporter. After that, Vittorio drifted. He 
              left Italy and wandered from job to job, city to city, chasing money but never passion.
              Then, one rainy morning in a forgotten part of town, Vittorio passed by a crumbling building with a 
              faded “For Lease” sign. Something in him clicked. He pulled out a weathered notebook he hadn't opened 
              in years—the one with his old shopping lists, secret recipes, and notes from his father. That was the 
              moment everything changed.

          <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>
              You play as Vittorio, starting from scratch. With nothing but your father's recipes and your own 
              determination, you begin rebuilding your life—one pizza at a time. Your shopping list becomes your 
              lifeline: plan ingredients, manage your budget, find the freshest produce, and slowly turn a broken 
              kitchen into a thriving pizzeria.Each day brings new challenges—rival pizza joints, harsh critics, 
              and surprise customers. But every dish you serve, every smile you earn, brings you closer to your 
              dream. As Vittorio rebuilds his life, it’s up to you, the player, to guide him through his journey 
              of redemption, flavor, and hope.

              "Many Students strugg to balance their food budgets, with many admitting to impulse buying d varing confidencei in their budgeting skills. Our group aims to develop fun soution t helps udnets priortize nutrients eating ith overspending."
              
              o balance ir foods The goal of our game was to create an engaging experience where players 
              can manage and grow their own business. From the start, our objective was 
              to simulate real-world decision-making in a fun, interactive way. We began 
              by outlining key gameplay mechanics—such as budgeting, purchasing, and scaling 
              operations—to reflect the challenges of starting and running a business.To bring
              our goal to life, we focused on simple, intuitive controls and a progression system 
              that rewards smart decisions. Players start with a limited budget and must make 
              strategic choices on how to spend it—whether on ingredients, equipment, or marketing. 
              These choices directly affect profits and growth, reinforcing the importance of planning 
              and adaptability.Throughout development, we stayed true to our core idea: teaching 
              basic business concepts through play. The result is a game thats not only entertaining 
              but also offers players insight into entrepreneurship and problem-solving.
