        <p> 
          <a href="files/presentation.pptx" download>Cooking Up Success</a> â€” Many students struggle to balance their food budgets, often admitting to impulse buying and lacking 
          confidence in their budgeting skills. Group 5, the Landlocked Ligers, set out to address this issue by designing 
          a game that encourages healthier financial and impulse decisions in a fun and engaging way. Our goal was to 
          create an interactive experience that helps students prioritize nutritious eating without overspending. We wanted 
          to highlight the real-life challenges of managing limited resources while promoting strategic thinking and planning. 
          Through gameplay, we hoped to provide both entertainment and educationâ€”offering a space where players can practice 
          and strengthen their budgeting skills in a low-risk environment.
