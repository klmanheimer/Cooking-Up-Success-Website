          <h2>Lore</h2>
            <p>
              Once a promising chef in Naples, Vittorio Bellini was the kind of man who could make a pizza sing. 
              His nonna taught him everything—how to knead dough with love, how to balance basil like poetry, and 
              how to taste life in every bite. Vittorio dreamed of opening his own pizzeria, but life had other 
              plans.One tragic night, a fire tore through his family’s restaurant. Not only did he lose the kitchen 
              he called home, but he also lost his father—his greatest supporter. After that, Vittorio drifted. He 
              left Italy and wandered from job to job, city to city, chasing money but never passion.
              Then, one rainy morning in a forgotten part of town, Vittorio passed by a crumbling building with a 
              faded “For Lease” sign. Something in him clicked. He pulled out a weathered notebook he hadn't opened 
              in years—the one with his old shopping lists, secret recipes, and notes from his father. That was the 
              moment everything changed.

          <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>
              You play as Vittorio, starting from scratch. With nothing but your father's recipes and your own 
              determination, you begin rebuilding your life—one pizza at a time. Your shopping list becomes your 
              lifeline: plan ingredients, manage your budget, find the freshest produce, and slowly turn a broken 
              kitchen into a thriving pizzeria.Each day brings new challenges—rival pizza joints, harsh critics, 
              and surprise customers. But every dish you serve, every smile you earn, brings you closer to your 
              dream. As Vittorio rebuilds his life, it’s up to you, the player, to guide him through his journey 
              of redemption, flavor, and hope.

              Many students struggle to balance their food budgets, often admitting to impulse buying and lacking 
              confidence in their budgeting skills. Group 5, the Landlocked Ligers, set out to address this issue by designing 
              a game that encourages healthier financial and impulse decisions in a fun and engaging way. Our goal was to 
              create an interactive experience that helps students prioritize nutritious eating without overspending. We wanted 
              to highlight the real-life challenges of managing limited resources while promoting strategic thinking and planning. 
              Through gameplay, we hoped to provide both entertainment and education—offering a space where players can practice 
              and strengthen their budgeting skills in a low-risk environment.
