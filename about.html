          <h2>Lore</h2>
            <p>
              Vinny Vortex wasn’t always Vinny. His real name was Victor Voss, a washed-up magician turned street performer 
              in a rundown corner of Las Vegas. Once hailed as “The Prince of Illusions,” Vinny had the kind of fame that burns 
              fast and disappears faster. One night, during his final show at a dingy casino, his greatest illusion failed — not 
              on stage, but in real life: his partner left, his act bombed, and the crowd threw chicken wings instead of roses.
              Rock bottom had a sticky floor.Desperate and broke, he wandered into a 24-hour market, trying to figure out what 
              came next. There, he stumbled on something strange in the discount bin — a pizza cookbook called "The Alchemy of 
              Dough", and tucked inside, a handwritten shopping list with a post-it note that read: "For when the magic fades — 
              try mozzarella." That night, Vinny used what little cash he had to buy everything on the list: fresh yeast, buffalo 
              mozzarella, fire-roasted tomatoes, and oddly… rosemary and cinnamon. He baked his first pizza in an abandoned food 
              truck behind his motel — and it was incredible.That was the moment it hit him: his next trick wouldn’t be on stage, 
              it would be on a plate. Vinny cleaned out the truck, painted flames on the side, and opened “Vinny Vortex’s Pizza 
              Portal” — a traveling pizza show that combined fire-spinning, sleight-of-hand, and artisan pizza tossed so high 
              it disappeared (sometimes literally).The shopping list? Still with him. Taped to the dashboard, greasy and 
              coffee-stained, it's been updated with notes like: “Add chili flakes: reminds me I’m alive.” “Never skimp on 
              crust. That’s where the soul lives.” Vinny’s pizza isn’t just food — it’s redemption, entertainment, and 
              proof that even when the magic’s gone, you can still rise.

              "Many Students strugg to balance their food budgets, with many admitting to impulse buying d varing confidencei in their budgeting skills. Our group aims to develop fun soution t helps udnets priortize nutrients eating ith overspending."
              
              o balance ir foods The goal of our game was to create an engaging experience where players 
              can manage and grow their own business. From the start, our objective was 
              to simulate real-world decision-making in a fun, interactive way. We began 
              by outlining key gameplay mechanics—such as budgeting, purchasing, and scaling 
              operations—to reflect the challenges of starting and running a business.To bring
              our goal to life, we focused on simple, intuitive controls and a progression system 
              that rewards smart decisions. Players start with a limited budget and must make 
              strategic choices on how to spend it—whether on ingredients, equipment, or marketing. 
              These choices directly affect profits and growth, reinforcing the importance of planning 
              and adaptability.Throughout development, we stayed true to our core idea: teaching 
              basic business concepts through play. The result is a game thats not only entertaining 
              but also offers players insight into entrepreneurship and problem-solving.
