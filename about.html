          <h2>Lore</h2>
            <p>Cooking Up Success was developed by a passionate team dedicated to blending 
              business strategy with gameplay fun. Our goal was to create a realistic 
              pizza-parlor startup simulation that's easy to pick up but full of challenging 
              decisions.

          <h2>About the makings of the game</h2>
            <p> 
              The goal of our game was to create an engaging experience where players 
              can manage and grow their own business. From the start, our objective was 
              to simulate real-world decision-making in a fun, interactive way. We began 
              by outlining key gameplay mechanics—such as budgeting, purchasing, and scaling 
              operations—to reflect the challenges of starting and running a business.To bring
              our goal to life, we focused on simple, intuitive controls and a progression system 
              that rewards smart decisions. Players start with a limited budget and must make 
              strategic choices on how to spend it—whether on ingredients, equipment, or marketing. 
              These choices directly affect profits and growth, reinforcing the importance of planning 
              and adaptability.Throughout development, we stayed true to our core idea: teaching 
              basic business concepts through play. The result is a game that’s not only entertaining 
              but also offers players insight into entrepreneurship and problem-solving.
